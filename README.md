# AES Hardware Implementation

This project contains a hardware implementation of the AES encryption algorithm, including both a standard design and a protected S-box variant.

## 🔐 Project Overview

- **Standard AES Implementation**: Includes all core AES modules along with simulation and synthesis details.
- **Masked S-box Implementation**: Uses 8-share boolean masking to protect against side-channel attacks such as DPA and CPA.
